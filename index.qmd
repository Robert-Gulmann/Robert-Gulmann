    <p>
      Hi, I'm Robert Gulmann, a final-year Business & Data Analytics student with a strong passion for finance, machine learning, and entrepreneurship. 
      I've worked in data analytics at EY and have experience in investment banking applications. I enjoy solving complex problems, developing innovative 
      business ideas, and staying ahead in the finance & tech space. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, you'll find me training at the gym, traveling, or working on new projects. 
      I’m currently focused on machine learning and financial markets, aiming to bridge the gap between data science and investment strategy.
    </p>
