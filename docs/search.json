    "section": "",
    "text": "‚Üê Back to Projects\n\n\nCar Sales Dataset Project & Presentation\n\n\nFor our group data analytics project, we chose to work with the ‚ÄúVehicle Sales and Market Trends Dataset‚Äù from Kaggle. This dataset stood out to us because of its size (over 550,000 rows) and the richness of information it offered. It contained detailed records of used car sales across the US, including data points like the make, model, year, odometer reading, condition, sale price, and Manheim Market Report (MMR) value. We were particularly drawn to this dataset not only because it was comprehensive and well-structured but also because car sales serve as a powerful economic indicator ‚Äî something that makes the data highly relevant and relatable to us as business students.\nI was responsible for the data cleansing and preparation stage of the project, which was a huge learning experience. When we first downloaded the dataset, we quickly realised it wasn‚Äôt ready for analysis. Some rows had data misaligned across columns, and the saledate field was in a messy format that included timezone information. To resolve these issues, I used Python with the pandas library. One script reformatted the saledate field to a clean YYYY-MM-DD format, and another filtered out any rows where the ‚Äòstate‚Äô field had more than two characters ‚Äî a clear sign of column shift errors.\nOnce the data was cleaned at a basic level in Python, I moved over to SQL (using pgAdmin) to create a structured database table. I imported the cleaned CSV and began refining it further: removing unnecessary columns like trim, vin, and seller; capitalising the first letter of key text fields for consistency; and deleting rows with more than two null values or unrealistic figures (like cars with 700,000+ miles or prices under $500). I also created a new column for the full name of each state and calculated the difference between the sale price and the MMR value to provide insights on over- or underpriced vehicles.\nPresenting this work to the class was a great experience. I spoke for two minutes about the entire data cleansing process ‚Äî what we started with, the issues we encountered, how I approached fixing them, and the impact that cleansing had on the quality of our insights. I kept my slide simple, letting the code and my explanation do the talking. The goal was to make it clear that clean, structured data is the foundation of any meaningful analysis ‚Äî and to show how even a great dataset from a reputable source still needs preparation.\nThis project helped solidify my skills in Python, SQL, and data cleaning workflows. More importantly, it showed me how valuable it is to present technical work in a way that‚Äôs accessible to others, especially when working in a team. I really enjoyed contributing to the technical side of this project and seeing the Power BI dashboards that my teammates created from the cleaned dataset. It felt like a proper end-to-end data pipeline ‚Äî and that‚Äôs exactly the kind of thing I want to keep building in my career."

    "section": "",
    "text": "‚Üê Back to Projects\n\n\nGoodbody SMF Competition ‚Äì 2nd Place Reflection\n\n\nIn March 2025, I competed in the prestigious Goodbody SMF Equity Portfolio Challenge, representing Dublin City University alongside a team of four peers. This national competition brought together student-managed funds from Ireland‚Äôs leading universities to present an actively managed equity portfolio to a panel of industry professionals at Goodbody Stockbrokers. Out of all participating teams, we placed second overall, an outcome I‚Äôm incredibly proud of given the calibre of competition and the depth of research involved.\nOur team‚Äôs strategy was to build a concentrated equity portfolio focused on high conviction, defensible positions across sectors, guided by a macroeconomic outlook that anticipated moderating inflation, stabilising interest rates, and sector-specific growth. I led the Airline sector pitch, covering both Ryanair (RYA.IR) and International Airlines Group (IAG.L). We allocated 8% of our total portfolio to these two stocks ‚Äî 5% to Ryanair and 3% to IAG ‚Äî based on a dual play of efficiency and value.\nWhat set our pitch apart was the depth of analysis. We didn‚Äôt just rely on headline numbers or P/E ratios ‚Äî I sourced and dissected seven professional equity research reports from firms including J.P. Morgan, RBC, Raymond James, and Deutsche Bank, extracting key financials, industry sentiment, and analyst price targets. Our thesis was backed by our own financial modelling, a multi-chart visualisation using Python, and sensitivity analysis showing the differentiated exposure Ryanair and IAG have to oil price volatility.\nThis competition challenged me to combine technical skills ‚Äî including Python-based data visualisation and PowerPoint design ‚Äî with clear, investor-oriented storytelling. For our final slide deck, I designed visuals with transparent PNGs that blended seamlessly into our branded Prezi slides. We made sure every graphic served a purpose ‚Äî whether highlighting Ryanair‚Äôs hedging strategy or benchmarking load factors and market cap.\nI also learned the value of team dynamics and presentation flow. Each of us presented for under two minutes, with carefully structured handovers between sectors to keep the energy up and message clear. In a high-stakes environment like this ‚Äî where you‚Äôre facing Goodbody analysts, fund managers, and recruiters ‚Äî clarity, confidence, and data integrity were key.\nPlacing second validated our research quality, communication skills, and strategic thinking. It also provided excellent exposure to the world of asset management and equity research, and I‚Äôve since used much of the work from the competition in interviews for graduate roles in banking and investment management.\nAbove all, this experience reaffirmed my passion for markets, equity analysis, and bringing ideas to life through storytelling. The Goodbody SMF Competition was more than just a pitch ‚Äî it was a test of critical thinking, collaboration, and how well we could defend our convictions in front of real professionals. I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity, and proud of how far we pushed ourselves to deliver something truly exceptional."

    "title": "\nHeart Disease Machine Learning Project ‚Äì Personal Reflection\n",
    "section": "",
    "text": "‚Üê Back to Projects\n\n\nHeart Disease Machine Learning Project ‚Äì Personal Reflection\n\n\nThis machine learning project was easily one of the most rewarding, eye-opening pieces of work I‚Äôve done during my final year. The goal was to build, evaluate, and reflect on three supervised learning models to predict the presence of heart disease using the Cleveland dataset. We tested each model on raw and preprocessed data and explored the impact of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). What started off as a fairly technical assignment ended up teaching me just as much about the real-world implications of AI in healthcare as it did about algorithms and performance metrics.\nMy Approach From the beginning, I knew I didn‚Äôt want to just get a model that performed well ‚Äî I wanted to understand why it performed the way it did. So I focused on three popular supervised models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Decision Tree Classifier. Each model had a distinct advantage: Logistic Regression for its interpretability, KNN for its adaptability in high-variance data, and Decision Trees for their intuitive visual structure.\nI began by preprocessing the Cleveland dataset, including a version where outliers were capped using the interquartile range method. This was an essential step, especially for models like KNN that are highly sensitive to scale and noise. Once that was done, I split the data into training and test sets (80/20), ran hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and evaluated each model using multiple metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.\nKey Outcomes KNN turned out to be the top-performing model in terms of pure predictive power. On the capped dataset (without PCA), it delivered the highest F1 score and AUC of any configuration, highlighting just how much distance-based models benefit from careful preprocessing. This result lined up with what I‚Äôd read from Shah, Patel, and Bharti (2020), who found similar trends in their work on heart disease prediction. It also validated my decision to take preprocessing seriously.\nThat said, performance isn‚Äôt everything. Logistic Regression, while not topping the charts in raw accuracy, stood out for its reliability and transparency. In healthcare, that matters ‚Äî a model might be 2 percent more accurate, but if it‚Äôs a black box, how can a doctor trust it? Ciu and Oetama (2020) put this well in their work on model explainability, and it really resonated with me while working on this.\nDecision Trees were interesting. They started strong and were the easiest to understand at a glance, but they suffered from overfitting. Even after hyperparameter tuning, they struggled to generalise, particularly on capped data. That said, their visual interpretability is something I‚Äôd still consider useful in certain settings ‚Äî maybe as part of a hybrid model or ensemble.\nThe PCA Factor One of the bigger learning curves for me was around PCA. I‚Äôd used it before in college but never fully appreciated its impact until now. When I applied PCA to reduce dimensionality while retaining 95% of the variance, the results were mixed. KNN improved with PCA, especially on the capped data, which made sense as PCA reduces noise and collinearity. For KNN, this meant cleaner distance calculations and better class separation.\nBut for Logistic Regression, PCA actually caused a drop in performance. This was expected in hindsight. Logistic models rely on the original features to draw interpretable relationships. When those features are transformed into principal components, some of that clarity is lost. G√°rate-Escamila et al.¬†(2020) described this really well, pointing out how PCA can strip away meaningful clinical variables. So while PCA has its place, I learned it‚Äôs not a one-size-fits-all solution.\nWhat I‚Äôd Do Differently Looking back, there are a few things I‚Äôd do differently if I had another go. First, I‚Äôd include k-fold cross-validation. While the train-test split gave me decent results, it doesn‚Äôt fully reflect how the models would perform on new unseen data. Cross-validation would add more robustness and help avoid the luck of a ‚Äúgood‚Äù split.\nI‚Äôd also explore ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting. I was limited by time and the scope of the module, but these techniques would have addressed the overfitting I ran into with Decision Trees and might have outperformed the individual models.\nFinally, I would love to incorporate more nuanced patient features into the dataset. Things like lifestyle, medication history, or genetic markers could provide additional predictive power and make the model outputs even more clinically relevant.\nSkills Gained On a technical level, this project helped me become much more confident with model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning. I got comfortable with the Scikit-learn pipeline and learned how to structure a real-world ML project from data import all the way to ROC curve analysis. I also got better at reading code outputs critically and translating those results into meaningful insights.\nFrom a soft skills perspective, this project really pushed me to think critically about trade-offs ‚Äî not just between accuracy and interpretability, but between short-term performance and long-term usability. In a world where AI models are making real decisions that impact people‚Äôs lives, that distinction matters.\nIt also improved my communication skills. Writing up the final report, I had to present technical results in a way that someone with a clinical background (or even no data background at all) could follow. That experience is going to be invaluable whether I end up working in data analytics, consulting, or healthcare tech.\nFinal Thoughts This wasn‚Äôt just a coding assignment. It was a chance to apply everything I‚Äôve learned over the last few years in a way that felt genuinely impactful. I wasn‚Äôt just building models ‚Äî I was simulating what it would be like to build tools that could assist in real diagnoses. I saw the tension between complexity and clarity, between predictive power and human understanding.\nKNN with outlier capping ended up being the best model in terms of performance. Logistic Regression, however, was the most trustworthy from a clinical perspective. Decision Trees brought an added layer of visualisation and reasoning but needed more regularisation. Each model taught me something different, and each one added to the broader picture of what good, responsible machine learning looks like in practice.\nThis project gave me more than grades or graphs. It gave me a clearer sense of how I want to apply these skills after university ‚Äî working on problems that actually matter, where accuracy and empathy go hand-in-hand."

The week-long entrepreneurship bootcamp brought together students from all over Europe, and being part of such a diverse and driven group pushed me outside my comfort zone in the best possible way. It wasn‚Äôt just about learning new skills ‚Äì it was about connecting with people, navigating cultural differences, and getting a glimpse of what international collaboration really looks like.\n\n      Our challenge was to develop a product or service that addressed a sustainability issue, and my team‚Äôs idea was ‚Äúwalk2zero‚Äù ‚Äì an incentivised walking feature that works within the 2zero app. The idea came from our own experience exploring Berlin. As a group, we tracked our steps each day and realised how much ground we covered ‚Äì nearly 12 km on foot in one day alone. We wanted to find a way to turn that kind of movement into something more meaningful, so we created a system that rewards tourists for walking and learning about the city‚Äôs history and culture, all while lowering their carbon footprint.\n\n      We tied our step counts to real environmental impact and calculated the CO2e saved by walking instead of taking the train, bus, or car. For 12km, that came out to 0.44 kg (train), 1.23 kg (bus), and 2.03 kg (car). These stats became part of our pitch and really helped us tell a clear story ‚Äì one that made sustainability more personal and tangible. It was also cool to back our concept with data we actually generated ourselves while walking around Berlin.\n\n      Working on ‚Äúwalk2zero‚Äù also helped me improve my presentation skills. Our group had to pitch our idea in a Dragon‚Äôs Den-style session to a panel of academic and industry professionals. It was fast-paced, and we had to be concise, confident, and clear. I presented the technical aspect of how the app feature would work and explained the reward system, as well as our vision for scaling it through AR experiences at landmarks across Berlin. The feedback we received was positive and constructive, and it gave me a lot of confidence in my ability to present real-world solutions.\n\n      Beyond the project, the trip itself was amazing. I loved being back in Berlin ‚Äì a city I‚Äôve visited before and really enjoy. We spent our evenings exploring, going to different areas, trying new foods, and bonding as a group. I also appreciated the structure of the programme: a mix of lectures, group work, pitching, and informal activities that helped everyone relax and get to know each other.\n\n      Overall, the BIP at HWR Berlin gave me practical experience in product ideation, teamwork, and sustainability ‚Äì all in an international setting. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôll definitely refer to in future job interviews and projects, and I‚Äôm proud of what we built together in such a short amount of time."

    "text": "‚Üê Back to Projects\n\n\nWashington Ireland Program ‚Äì Class of 2025 Reflection\n\n\nBeing accepted into the Washington Ireland Program (WIP) Class of 2025 is something I‚Äôm incredibly proud of and excited for. From the moment I learned about the program, I felt like it was something that aligned closely with my values, interests, and ambitions. It brings together young people from across the island of Ireland and challenges them to grow not just as professionals, but as people. For me, it‚Äôs a huge opportunity to push myself outside of my comfort zone and grow in ways I couldn‚Äôt in a classroom alone.\nWIP‚Äôs focus on service, leadership, and cross-cultural collaboration was what drew me in from the start. Over the last few years, I‚Äôve really leaned into opportunities to lead, serve others, and explore how I can use data and technology to solve real-world problems. Whether it was building a startup with my friends, working on policy projects at university, or volunteering with Meals on Wheels and the Simon Community, I‚Äôve come to appreciate how powerful it can be when you combine personal drive with purpose. I applied to WIP because I want to refine those qualities and develop into a more thoughtful and inclusive leader.\nThe application process itself was a valuable experience. From writing about my motivations and values to the individual and group interviews, it pushed me to reflect on what kind of leader I want to become. During the group exercise in particular, I learned the importance of listening, encouraging input from quieter voices, and making space for different perspectives‚Äîsomething I now try to carry into every group setting I‚Äôm in.\nI also found the community aspect of WIP hugely appealing. Throughout the process, I spoke with past participants and was struck by how connected and supportive the alumni network is. It‚Äôs clear that WIP isn‚Äôt just a summer program‚Äîit‚Äôs a long-term investment in people who care deeply about the future of the island and want to be part of shaping it. The idea of joining that community and contributing to it going forward really excites me.\nThis summer, I‚Äôll be heading to Washington, D.C., for two months to work with a U.S. organisation and take part in WIP‚Äôs leadership curriculum. I‚Äôm especially looking forward to meeting and learning from people from different backgrounds and with different views to my own. I‚Äôve realised over time that the best growth comes from conversations that challenge how you think and encourage you to step outside of what you know.\nIn the lead-up to the summer, I‚Äôll be taking part in orientation weekends and workshops designed to help us prepare, and I‚Äôm genuinely buzzing for what lies ahead. I know it‚Äôs going to be intense, but I also know that experiences like this don‚Äôt come around often. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to have been selected, and I‚Äôm looking forward to making the most of it‚Äînot just for myself, but for the people and communities I‚Äôll serve down the line."

    "text": "‚Üê Back to Projects\n\n\nMy Journey with StockPath\n\n\nMy journey with StockPath has been one of the most rewarding and intense experiences of my college life. From the very beginning, when our group came together to brainstorm ideas, I was drawn to the potential of solving a real problem for small and medium retailers. We knew early on that stock-taking was a frustrating and time-consuming process for a lot of businesses, so we came up with StockPath ‚Äî a mobile-first, AI-powered stock management system that simplifies inventory checks and provides actionable insights.\nAs the CTO of the group, I was responsible for all things technical. Early on, this meant translating our idea into something that could actually work ‚Äî not just on paper, but as a real product. I spent a lot of time researching similar solutions, exploring different tech stacks, and figuring out how we could integrate our system into existing EDI and POS frameworks used by retailers. I wanted StockPath to be simple to use but powerful under the hood.\nA huge part of my role involved prototyping. I built interactive mockups of both the app and the web dashboard using Figma, which allowed us to visually explain our idea to mentors, classmates, and eventually, the Dragons. These prototypes became the backbone of our presentations and helped everyone understand how the product would actually function day to day.\nFor the Dragon‚Äôs Den pitch, I was in charge of presenting the technical side of StockPath. I created slides explaining our software architecture, our use of cloud storage and security, and how we could scale over time. I also answered some pretty tough technical questions from the panel, and I was proud of how confidently I could explain the inner workings of our system.\nThe written business plan was another huge task. I was fully responsible for the Research & Development section and wrote detailed content on how the product works, our long-term roadmap for future features like RFID integration, and the technologies we‚Äôre using to bring it all together. I also wrote the official technical product description, laying out what StockPath is as both a mobile app and web tool, so that someone with no technical background could still get it.\nLooking back, I‚Äôve gained so much from this project ‚Äî not just in terms of hard skills like Figma, cloud infrastructure, and technical writing, but also soft skills like leadership, communication, and working in a team. I learned how to simplify complex ideas, how to take feedback constructively, and how to step up when things needed to get done.\nMost importantly, StockPath made me realise how much I enjoy building solutions that have a real-world impact. It‚Äôs pushed me to consider tech entrepreneurship as a real option after college, and it‚Äôs given me the confidence to back myself when pitching ideas.\nThis wasn‚Äôt just a college assignment. For me, it was a glimpse into the kind of work I want to do ‚Äî solving problems, building great products, and doing it all with a team I trust."
