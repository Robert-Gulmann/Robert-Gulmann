<h2>
Washington Ireland Program – Class of 2025 Reflection
</h2>
<p>
Being accepted into the Washington Ireland Program (WIP) Class of 2025 is something I’m incredibly proud of and excited for. From the moment I learned about the program, I felt like it was something that aligned closely with my values, interests, and ambitions. It brings together young people from across the island of Ireland and challenges them to grow not just as professionals, but as people. For me, it’s a huge opportunity to push myself outside of my comfort zone and grow in ways I couldn’t in a classroom alone.
</p>
<p>
WIP’s focus on service, leadership, and cross-cultural collaboration was what drew me in from the start. Over the last few years, I’ve really leaned into opportunities to lead, serve others, and explore how I can use data and technology to solve real-world problems. Whether it was building a startup with my friends, working on policy projects at university, or volunteering with Meals on Wheels and the Simon Community, I’ve come to appreciate how powerful it can be when you combine personal drive with purpose. I applied to WIP because I want to refine those qualities and develop into a more thoughtful and inclusive leader.
</p>
<p>
The application process itself was a valuable experience. From writing about my motivations and values to the individual and group interviews, it pushed me to reflect on what kind of leader I want to become. During the group exercise in particular, I learned the importance of listening, encouraging input from quieter voices, and making space for different perspectives—something I now try to carry into every group setting I’m in.
</p>
<p>
I also found the community aspect of WIP hugely appealing. Throughout the process, I spoke with past participants and was struck by how connected and supportive the alumni network is. It’s clear that WIP isn’t just a summer program—it’s a long-term investment in people who care deeply about the future of the island and want to be part of shaping it. The idea of joining that community and contributing to it going forward really excites me.
</p>
<p>
This summer, I’ll be heading to Washington, D.C., for two months to work with a U.S. organisation and take part in WIP’s leadership curriculum. I’m especially looking forward to meeting and learning from people from different backgrounds and with different views to my own. I’ve realised over time that the best growth comes from conversations that challenge how you think and encourage you to step outside of what you know.
</p>
<p>
In the lead-up to the summer, I’ll be taking part in orientation weekends and workshops designed to help us prepare, and I’m genuinely buzzing for what lies ahead. I know it’s going to be intense, but I also know that experiences like this don’t come around often. I’m incredibly grateful to have been selected, and I’m looking forward to making the most of it—not just for myself, but for the people and communities I’ll serve down the line.
