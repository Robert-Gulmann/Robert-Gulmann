<h2>
My Journey with StockPath
</h2>
<p>
My journey with StockPath has been one of the most rewarding and intense experiences of my college life. From the very beginning, when our group came together to brainstorm ideas, I was drawn to the potential of solving a real problem for small and medium retailers. We knew early on that stock-taking was a frustrating and time-consuming process for a lot of businesses, so we came up with StockPath — a mobile-first, AI-powered stock management system that simplifies inventory checks and provides actionable insights.
</p>
<p>
As the CTO of the group, I was responsible for all things technical. Early on, this meant translating our idea into something that could actually work — not just on paper, but as a real product. I spent a lot of time researching similar solutions, exploring different tech stacks, and figuring out how we could integrate our system into existing EDI and POS frameworks used by retailers. I wanted StockPath to be simple to use but powerful under the hood.
</p>
<p>
A huge part of my role involved prototyping. I built interactive mockups of both the app and the web dashboard using Figma, which allowed us to visually explain our idea to mentors, classmates, and eventually, the Dragons. These prototypes became the backbone of our presentations and helped everyone understand how the product would actually function day to day.
</p>
<p>
For the Dragon’s Den pitch, I was in charge of presenting the technical side of StockPath. I created slides explaining our software architecture, our use of cloud storage and security, and how we could scale over time. I also answered some pretty tough technical questions from the panel, and I was proud of how confidently I could explain the inner workings of our system.
</p>
<p>
The written business plan was another huge task. I was fully responsible for the Research & Development section and wrote detailed content on how the product works, our long-term roadmap for future features like RFID integration, and the technologies we’re using to bring it all together. I also wrote the official technical product description, laying out what StockPath is as both a mobile app and web tool, so that someone with no technical background could still get it.
</p>
<p>
Looking back, I’ve gained so much from this project — not just in terms of hard skills like Figma, cloud infrastructure, and technical writing, but also soft skills like leadership, communication, and working in a team. I learned how to simplify complex ideas, how to take feedback constructively, and how to step up when things needed to get done.
</p>
<p>
Most importantly, StockPath made me realise how much I enjoy building solutions that have a real-world impact. It’s pushed me to consider tech entrepreneurship as a real option after college, and it’s given me the confidence to back myself when pitching ideas.
</p>
<p>
This wasn’t just a college assignment. For me, it was a glimpse into the kind of work I want to do — solving problems, building great products, and doing it all with a team I trust.
