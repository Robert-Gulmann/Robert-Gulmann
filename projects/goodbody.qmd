Goodbody SMF Competition – 2nd Place Reflection
</h1>
<p>
In March 2025, I competed in the prestigious Goodbody SMF Equity Portfolio Challenge, representing Dublin City University alongside a team of four peers. This national competition brought together student-managed funds from Ireland’s leading universities to present an actively managed equity portfolio to a panel of industry professionals at Goodbody Stockbrokers. Out of all participating teams, we placed second overall, an outcome I’m incredibly proud of given the calibre of competition and the depth of research involved.

Our team’s strategy was to build a concentrated equity portfolio focused on high conviction, defensible positions across sectors, guided by a macroeconomic outlook that anticipated moderating inflation, stabilising interest rates, and sector-specific growth. I led the Airline sector pitch, covering both Ryanair (RYA.IR) and International Airlines Group (IAG.L). We allocated 8% of our total portfolio to these two stocks — 5% to Ryanair and 3% to IAG — based on a dual play of efficiency and value.

What set our pitch apart was the depth of analysis. We didn't just rely on headline numbers or P/E ratios — I sourced and dissected seven professional equity research reports from firms including J.P. Morgan, RBC, Raymond James, and Deutsche Bank, extracting key financials, industry sentiment, and analyst price targets. Our thesis was backed by our own financial modelling, a multi-chart visualisation using Python, and sensitivity analysis showing the differentiated exposure Ryanair and IAG have to oil price volatility.

This competition challenged me to combine technical skills — including Python-based data visualisation and PowerPoint design — with clear, investor-oriented storytelling. For our final slide deck, I designed visuals with transparent PNGs that blended seamlessly into our branded Prezi slides. We made sure every graphic served a purpose — whether highlighting Ryanair’s hedging strategy or benchmarking load factors and market cap.

I also learned the value of team dynamics and presentation flow. Each of us presented for under two minutes, with carefully structured handovers between sectors to keep the energy up and message clear. In a high-stakes environment like this — where you're facing Goodbody analysts, fund managers, and recruiters — clarity, confidence, and data integrity were key.

Placing second validated our research quality, communication skills, and strategic thinking. It also provided excellent exposure to the world of asset management and equity research, and I’ve since used much of the work from the competition in interviews for graduate roles in banking and investment management.

Above all, this experience reaffirmed my passion for markets, equity analysis, and bringing ideas to life through storytelling. The Goodbody SMF Competition was more than just a pitch — it was a test of critical thinking, collaboration, and how well we could defend our convictions in front of real professionals. I'm grateful for the opportunity, and proud of how far we pushed ourselves to deliver something truly exceptional.
